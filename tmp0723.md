## Job Objective  
AI Application R&D Engineer  


## Educational Background  

- **2016.08 - 2019.06**  
  Tsinghua University  
  Master of Control Science and Engineering  
  Research direction: Application of deep learning in the field of petroleum logging. Collaborated with China National Offshore Oil Corporation and published 2 EI papers as the first author.  

- **2011.09 - 2015.06**  
  Shandong University  
  Bachelor of Electrical Engineering and Automation  
  Awards: National Encouragement Scholarship, First-class Scholarship of Shandong University, Changyuan Group Scholarship, etc.  


## Work Experience  

- **2021.05 - Present**  
  Independent Research on Quantitative Strategies  

  Engaged in full-time quantitative trading in the web3 industry, implementing the following projects using machine learning technologies:  

  **Automatic Reminder of Short-term Trading Signals**  
  (1) Summarized the most reliable trading signals from manual market monitoring, and implemented rule-based signal detection using Python, such as detecting whether all cryptocurrencies have a "sideways breakout" pattern and issuing alerts.  
  (2) Used models like LSTM for short-term price prediction of major cryptocurrencies.  
  Compared with traditional financial markets, it is more difficult to obtain effective factors for cryptocurrencies, making regression problems hard to achieve good results. Therefore, it is only used as a classification problem for upward prediction: given a price sequence of a certain length, predict the probability of an upward movement in the next trading cycle. This strategy can assist in market judgment, prompt trading opportunities, and reduce the pressure of manual market monitoring.  

  **Reinforcement Learning-based Portfolio Rotation Strategy**  
  Manually selected several cryptocurrencies with the most short-term potential, trained reinforcement learning agents using historical data, and achieved maximum total assets through dynamic adjustment of asset allocation. After training, it can accept real-time data from exchanges to implement the asset rotation strategy and update the target network regularly to ensure the agent adapts to the latest data.  
  Design of the reinforcement learning module: State is the current position information, Action is the asset allocation operation, Reward is the asset return rate after each decision, and Agent is a DQN network with experience replay and greedy strategy.  
  This rotation strategy has a significant improvement in asset return rate compared to average purchase or single purchase and can be used initially.  


- **2019.06 - 2021.04**  
  Zuoyebang Education Technology Co., Ltd.  
  Position: Recommendation Algorithm Engineer  

  Team Background: Zuoyebang holds over 70% of the market share in online education photo-based question search. In-app course recommendation is the main commercial monetization method of Zuoyebang. The main task of the recommendation algorithm team is to improve the conversion rate of internal advertisements (from exposure to order placement).  

  Job Responsibilities: Responsible for improving the conversion rate of internal courses in the entire junior high school department. Undertaking the iteration of ranking models, mining user portraits, docking with the big data team, and docking with the needs of course operations. Key work includes:  

  **Iteration of Ranking Models**  
  Developed a multi-task learning model, combining MMoE with ESMM to optimize both ctr and cvr simultaneously. To address the large data differences among users of different grades, the model was improved as follows: taking 3 junior high school grades as an example, different grades share the underlying input data and use 3 separate MMoE modules to optimize each grade. This model achieved the best online performance during the same period. Similar strategies were subsequently adopted for different customers and advertising positions. By April 2021, MMoE models occupied the main traffic online. The ctcvr of this model was 14% higher than that of random placement and 4% higher than the original best model (wide&deep).  

  **Design and Iteration of Strategy-based Statistical Models**  
  Course advertisement ideas change frequently, with frequent updates, removals, and modifications. The placement logic and crowd targeting for courses of different prices are unstable. These business characteristics often cause instability in DNN models. Therefore, we developed strategy-based statistical models. By counting real posterior data, different strategies were used for different advertising positions and user groups, and Thompson and UCB algorithms were used at the algorithm level. After multiple iterations, such models became stable base models online, and their stability was better demonstrated during winter/summer vacations and midterm/final exam periods.  

  **Feature Engineering**  
  To alleviate the data sparsity problem, positive sample augmentation was implemented for specific advertising positions. The user-item co-occurrence matrix was used as input, and VAE was used to generate new sample sets. Different threshold strategies were tried to screen new positive samples. The DNN model trained with the augmented sample set outperformed the original model. The new model achieved positive returns in the "homepage text link" advertising position with sparse online data.  
  Modeled user behaviors in the Zuoyebang APP to extract new user features, including user clicks on advertisements, photo-based question searches, and posting. Used VAE to reduce the dimensionality of user behavior vectors, generated user embedding features, and applied them in ranking models.  

  **Big Data Services**  
  (1) Responsible for ETL generation from hourly log tables to training data.  
  (2) Cooperated with the big data team to upgrade the update frequency of ranking models from daily to hourly.  


- **2018.04 - 2018.07**  
  Kuaishou Technology (Intern)  
  Position: Computer Vision Algorithm Engineer  
  Responsible for work related to image semantic segmentation, mainly including cleaning Kuaishou's gesture segmentation dataset and implementing the DeepLabv3 semantic segmentation model algorithm.
